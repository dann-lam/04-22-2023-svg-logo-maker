## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://dann-lam.github.io/04-08-2023-Weather-Dashboard/)

This is a weather site that returns the forecast for the day, as well as a five day forecast.

When clicked, your city will be saved onto a favorites list that is stored on the local storage. You can have up to 5 favorites at the moment, with the last city on the list dropped for the newest one.

This was created to exercise the fundamentals of Javascript fetch requests for APIs, at the moment the 5 day forecast will return information forecasts for 3PM specifically.

It practices some of the other Javasript fundamentals, selecting of IDs, event listeners for buttons, local storage of items in favorites, dynamic object creation and appending, and logic for handling items coming from API calls.

Future features when I come back to this: Currently the API returns the top 5 search results for a given city. It would be nice if the search created a dropdown that returned those searches, so that if you choose a city with a name with the same name at a different location, the user is given that choice.

The styling is a bit scuffed, but it's functional for our purposes.

## Usage

Simply insert your city in the search box, and click on the search box.

This will display your forecast along with a five day forecast.

The search will be saved as a button, you can save up to five buttons before the last favorite in the list is dropped in favor for a new one.

## Learning Points

I got great practice working with API requests and navigating the objects that they return.

Another thing I apppreciated was working with some of the challenges of working with objects in localStorage and the some of the logic behind how the buttons work.

I currently have somewhat of an unorthodox solution for grabbing the days from the five day forecast, and they're split into 3 hour segments. It's essentially looking for that day at specifically 3PM. This can be seen here:

# 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## Your Task

Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. You’ll need to submit a link to the video **and** add it to the README of your project.

Refer to the [Video Submission Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.

> **Note**: There is no starter code for this assignment.
### User Story

```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated SVG given the following input entered by the user: `SVG` for the text, `white` for the text color, `circle` from the list of shapes, and `green` for the shape color. Note that this is just an image of the output SVG and not the SVG file itself:

## Additional Requirements

This Challenge combines many of the skills covered so far. In addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria, we’ve provided some guidelines to help you get started.

Because this Challenge requires a video submission, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog video submission guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) for guidance on creating and sharing a video.

Your application should use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like the following example:

```md
.
├── examples/           // Example svg file(s) created with the app
├── lib/                // Folder for classes or functions
    ├── shapes.js       // Exports `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes
    ├── shapes.test.js  // Jest tests for shapes
    └── more...         // Additional files and tests
├── .gitignore          // Indicates which folders and files Git should ignore
├── index.js            // Runs the application using imports from lib/
├── package.json
└── README.md           // App description, link to video, setup and usage instructions
```

> **Important**: Make sure that you remove `dist` from the `.gitignore` file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.
The application must include `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest. While not a requirement, it is recommended that you place any common functionality and properties shared by the `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes in a parent `Shape` class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.

Each shape class should be tested for a `render()` method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.

The following example test should pass:

```js
const shape = new Triangle();
shape.setColor("blue");
expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />');
```

You may need to add additional files in the `lib` folder for handling user input, writing to a file, etc. Writing tests for these additional files is **optional**.
