## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://dann-lam.github.io/04-22-2023-svg-logo-maker/)

This is a logo generate app that returns a simple svg located in the output folder.

It'll allow for three characters along with a simple shape, a rectangle, a circle, or a square.

When activated, you'll be sent through a few simple text promps in the console.
This exercise was practiced mostly to exercise the fundamentals of how Node, unit testing, and prompting works in conjunction with creating elements for use on a web page or app.

In the future, a superior version of unit testing, and strictly rules for inputs on our inquirer prompts would be good. If one doesn't follow the rules super strictly it's possible to simply output an SVG that does not work.

## Usage

To use this project, one must install node in the folder.

Next, run "node index.js" in the top directory.

You'll be given simple prompts, upon answering them correctly you will receive your SVG in the output folder.

## Learning Points

In this project, we had great practice working with creating classes, working with inquirer to create our prompt promises, and some unit testing of problems.

One thing i'd like to work on in the future is being able to set up robust error handling on incorrect inputs for our prompts.

Because there are many ways of solving these problems, it would also be fun to explore different methods of creating our classes, and discovering which methods would be the most efficient.
